METADATA DOT TEXT

Very long list of dates, descriptions, titles, etc. Boring, unless like me you want an 
easy way to keep track of when art pieces were made, what they're called, and so on.

Largely sorted by upload date (to the git repo), from new to old.

Title: Hapell the Eyeball's Photo!!!!
Tools used: FlipAnim, Huion HS64

I didn't expect my first drawing in flipanim to be this good... damn. Anyways, this is that eyeball fellow, he's my persona. I was going to just use
my name for him but the anagram Hapell is way better, since it rhymes with eyeball and it rolls off the tongue better.

Title: My Persona's Reference Sheet

A double whammy of descriptions!

Deviantart:
Totally didn't steal from The Residents, no sirree...


...I mean, of course, I'm only joking that I stole from the Residents. It'd be much more appropriate to say inspired or something, IDK.


The original file also has him in two different art styles, too, they're just hidden layers though so I'm not gonna bother making space for them here.

Tumblr:
My new persona, an eyeball-headed individual. I have nothing else to say...

Title: Meet Impy
Tools used: Krita, Huion HS610

Description:
Meet Impy. She's got beige-ish brown fur, vibrant eyes the color of the sun, long pointy and a toothy grin. A feisty, mischievous and playful mammalian, you'd think she'd believe that she's got the best life a pet could ever had... until she ended up in Rachel's care, she hated it. Most of the owners she had would treat her as some sort of trophy, considering the fact that her species had barely been fully domesticated for others to raise as pets. However, said species is known for striking down anything in its path for food or as a form of self defense, so I guess you could say that Impy's aggressive nature checks out. With Rachel (who is not in this drawing), she's able to be the witty and scheming little deviant she's always longed to be, roaming around the world with her companion.

Of all the places to come up with such an idea, I'm flabbergasted that it had to be Sonichu... I'm not kidding. (link to https://sonichu.com/w/images/d/d9/SchuComic10P7.jpg) Those little disgusting pale-fleshed horned miscreants named "Devil Trolls" ruining Chris-Chan's little museum? That's what influenced the creation of this character. It looks more like a Chao to me, though, so maybe that was a subconscious influence? Hmm...

Title: Besides, he's got a cute name now: Torso Boy! What's he complaining about?!
Tools used: Notebook, random blue colored pencil

Yes, it's an Albuquerque and "No Arms No Legs Girl In Hospital" reference. Sort of. Kind of. Not really. 
So, little wee Andre Iovine (the guy without limbs) and Alastor Bates have a little beef with 
each other. Andre breaks Alastor's favorite golden staff after borrowing it on Halloween night for 
a costume party, and Alastor, having anger management issues, is absolutely upset with Andre and rips 
his arms and legs with his mouth out of spite. After realizing what he's done, Alastor takes him to a 
hospital and apologizes. Andre is still distraught by the whole legless thing, and never forgives him 
for it depsite Alastor forgiving him for breaking his staff.

Title: Nelson, Augustus and Alastor

Three characters: one I haven't drawn in ages, another I hadn't drawn in a while, and one 
that I just couldn't seem to figure out up until now. I actually came up with the idea of 
them taking their picture on a whim trying to figure out what to draw, and I looked through this 
very site and picked out three characters. Ironically, all of them were conceived around 2023. 
The piece was originally sized at 5100x382, and this was on a mid-2007 iMac running 32-bit Windows 
of all things! So now it's my daily driver for drawing.

Tools used: ibisPaint, School Chromebook, fingers

Wow, the only comment on the post is right... I did forget about him! I think this was 
some sort of Gacha Life OC (explains the jank and the misshapen skull) that I made around 
my Nightmare phase, where a shitload of characters were at some point sadistic and unforgiving.

For a cancelled web series idea I had brewing in my head in 2020. I had a ton of ideas
like these... oh well, let bygones be bygones! Especially since I'd probably get strange
looks if I actually finished it.

Title: William and Someone
Tools used: Kleki, School Chromebook, likely a built-in stylus or Wacom CTL-4100WL

I shit you not, the filename in Google Drive was "williamandsomeone.png". I didn't bother
giving the bat security guard a name, but of course the more Gordon-looking one gets the
name William. This is a clue as to which one is the NPC and which one is the main 
character.

Title: Alastor Sketches Part 2/2
Tools used: Notebook, HB Pencil
Date: 2025/02/06

Description:
Part two of two Alastor sketches I did, now solely focusing on the human form. I ended up
getting the ragdoll idea since the human form had eyes similar to 2D's (the singer from
Gorillaz. The cartoon one, not Damon). I have nothing else to say.

Part one of two Alastor sketches I did, this one being of his true form: a serpent-like
body with horns and cat eyes, now with 10x more sciera. I gave him those line thingies
(I'm not sure if I can call them scales) since the human form had a hat with those same
lines, I thought it would serve as a subtle hint.
