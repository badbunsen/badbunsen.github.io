				<h2>third person view bio</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Aleph Diallo</strong> is a (currently) teenage visual artist from New York who loves to look through old websites from time to time. In an effort to combine his love for cartoons and his love for web design, he started to create a website independent from social media to share his works starting from 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ever since birth (2009/10/23), or&mdash;to be more precise&mdash;when he first started to learn how to use a pencil, Aleph Diallo has had an affinity for drawing characters. Thanks to a diet of nothing but scratched Nickelodeon DVDs, Cartoon Network shows and later on during his adolescent years things like South Park and Homestar Runner, he started to take art seriously. Believing that he could make a living with his craft, he signed up for every social media and art site he could get his grubby hands on. One of these was a once famous site called DeviantArt, and it is here that the username "badbunsen" originated from, a portmanteau of "bad" and the character Bunsen from Bunsen is a Beast.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, nothing of absolute note has happened yet, as it either has to do with juvenile Scratch drama, middle school woes or underperforming YouTube videos.
