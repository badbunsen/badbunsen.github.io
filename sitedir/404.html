	<p>The requested page was not found on the server. <a href="/">It might be best to go to the homepage to find what you want.</a><br>
	Here's a couple of reasons as to why that might be:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>This site might still be under construction. Come back later!</li>
		<!-- Check the wayback machine for this stuff, it really works -->
		<li id="archived">The page might have existed, but it got deleted at some point.</li>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var theURL = window.location.href;
		var archived = document.getElementById("archived");
		var archivedURL = "http://web.archive.org/web/*/" + theURL;
		archived.innerHTML = '<a href="' + archivedURL + '" target="_blank">' + archived.innerHTML + '</a>';
		</script>
		<li id="archived_rr">The page might have existed... on rubberocket.com.</li>
		<script type="text/javascript">
		var therrURL = "https://rubberocket.com" + window.location.pathname;
		var archived_rr = document.getElementById("archived_rr");
		var archived_rr_URL = "http://web.archive.org/web/*/" + therrURL;
		archived_rr.innerHTML = '<a href="' + archived_rr_URL + '" target="_blank">' + archived_rr.innerHTML + '</a>';
		</script>
		<li>The page has likely moved. <a href="/">Check the homepage and go from there.</a></li>
		<li>The page has never existed and probably never will.</li>
		<li>Hackers from Elbonia took down the page for slandering their name.</li>
		<li>The page used nothing but Adobe Flash and had to be removed to get with the times.</li>
		<li>The page was very old and was from a much different era in my life. It would probably still exist here if this were the case, or it'd be archived neatly.</li>
		<li>The page fucking sucked.</li>
		<li>The page contained media from Paramount-owned properties.</li>
	</ul>
