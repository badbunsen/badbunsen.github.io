> Forgot to mention this the other day, but bitmaps will automatically be 
  used depending on whatever browser you're using, thanks to the 
  &lt;picture&gt; tag.
> Look at those CSS animations, dude. Rather, transformations. An actual 
  animate attribute would screw up some things before hovering.
> Unfortunately for my old browser friends... all five of you... the eye 
  candy added will not work. Sorry!
> Removal of fake ads and goods link. May the latter rest in peace and 
  someday rise back up to suck blood or some shit. Like a vampire.
(edit from 2024/08/08: fuck i forgot to remove em)
    
16 July 2024

> Replaced logos with vectors, I think there's no need to support
  old browsers anymore, as long as they support SVGs. And CSS animation. 
  Hmm... that narrows down the possible browsers a bit.

> Deleted guestbook for now due to lack of interest. 
  There's still email anyway

16 June 2024

> Guestbook!

9 June 2024

> Dark theme for all the people who want to conserve battery
life.
> Fake ads because real ones are worse
> 88x31 buttons!
> Stuff I Use section added
    
4 June 2024

> New art stylesheet. Bland, I know.

> Now I'm editing this site on my new laptop. It's fine I suppose.
> Compressed the art page previews. Now your grandma's dial up
connection can load 'em up fast.
> I know there's not much new art, shut up

1 June 2024

> Brand new redesign, also moved updates to this very page
> Updating every page with this design once again
(finished @ 11:53 PM EST [23:53])
> I got a new gaming laptop but I'm not editing the site with it. 
I should've done that, though.

> Return of the asterisk
> Sorry for not updating this site often, I have responsibilities.
I'm also going to be getting a new computer, so if you want
new animations, wait a month and seven days. Thanks.

28 April 2024

> in the process of converting every page to this style.
